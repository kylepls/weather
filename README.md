### About

##### The Basics

This is a super simple webapp that shows you the weather and some other neat things. It is designed so that it can be run 24/7 on a display. 

There are some nice little details:

* The wind icon will make a blowing animation if it is windy outside.
* The compass points in the direction of the wind.
* The thermometer changes color and height depending on the temperature.
* The cloud will either rain or snow if percipitation is occurring.

Currently all data for the app is pulled from [darksky.net](https://darksky.net)
